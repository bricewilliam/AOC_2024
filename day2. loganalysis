/// Day2 AOC Wihter Event 
SIEM is defined as Security Information and Event Management 
Class presents a VM, or Virtual Machine, for SIEM evironment using software called Elastic. 
Instructor identifies how to identiy time period, for data logs, and filters, by type e.g., hostname or user.name, etc 
In specific for sourcetype, we use the following. Host.hostname,user.name, process.command_line,event_outcome,source.ip , event.category 
Instructor shows time period 12.01.24 0900 until 12.01.24 0930 
Performs basic filter, or data result, and finds numerous logs from user server admin and ip 10.0.11.11 
After this, instructor asks class to expand time field from 12.01.24 to a beginning date of 11.29.24 
Once action is performed, instructor illustrates a potential " force in" or attempt to unveil password by guessing entry into account 
Subsequent, instructor asks class to refilter by event.category and remove filtering for source ip, to gander as to what other ips could be involved 
Able to illustrate a brute force attack from a different ip address 10.0.255.1 Instructor notes this is possibly being executed using software Netexec
Bruteforce attack is confirmed successful by instructor, illustrating supposed user was able to access environment 
After identifying brute force attack, instructor asks class to remove filters to look into what supposed user is doing 
Following unfilter, it is noted by instructor, seems to be a powershell command being run under process command line by supposed user 
Instructor asks class to copy this line of powershell code and put into input on external site CyberChef  
Able to identify encoded message using AI tool, found out powershell command is a base64 encoded message 
Using Cyberchef, able to identify using powershell input and operations or recipe from base64 and decode text
  Install-WindowsUpdate -AcceptAll -AutoReboot 
  ^ Identified message or output as preceding message 
  Looks per instructor and output that supposed user is trying to install windows updates.
